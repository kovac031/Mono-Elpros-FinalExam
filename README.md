- SSMS 19
- SourceTree
- Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code

## What is it?
> I copied the repository of the group task which was the final exam in my 255-hours intensive back-end dev course for beginners. As part of a 4-person team, we decided to make an MVC app that would act as a board games rental service. We called it PlayPal.
- [PlayPal's original repository](https://github.com/jelenatufekovic/Elpros-grupa1/tree/develop)

### The team (myself excluded):
- [Barbara](https://github.com/BarbaraFriscic)
- [Luka](https://github.com/TalikTom)
- [Nikola](https://github.com/AntovskiN)
- [teacher Jelena](https://github.com/jelenatufekovic)

## Learning points:
- planning the project
  - writing the specifications
  - database design based on specifications
    - tables, relations, foreign keys
    - all tables must have (Id of course) CreatedBy, UpdatedBy, DateCreated, DateUpdated
- creating the database
  - creating the tables
  - inserting values into tables
  - altering tables
- dividing coding tasks
  - GitHub Projects
  - Pull requests
  - using SourceTree to make branches, commits, push and pull branches, rebase
  - using Visual Studio Code to resolve merge conflicts
- multilayer architecture - controller, service, repository, data access layer
- dependency injection, Autofac
- Entity Framework database connection
- CRUD, mapping using View models and DTO models
- using MVC Razor pages, using partial Views
- form based authentication, role based authorization, retrieving authenticated user data for mapping

## My projects based on this
Due to me not having meaningful coding experience prior to this intensive course, a lot of knowledge didn't really stick, so I practiced some more:

- [PlayPalMini - MVC](https://github.com/kovac031/PlayPalMini-MVC)
> A mini version of PlayPal, also as MVC app, so I can do it all by myself and make sure I learned it all!

- [PlayPalMini - WebAPI](https://github.com/kovac031/PlayPalMini-WebAPI)
> Prior to learning MVC, we learned REST API and using Postman, and another group in the course did the final exam like that, so I wanted to do it too!
